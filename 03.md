## Exercise 3: Use Azure Blueprints to govern your Azure environment

Duration: 75 minutes

In this exercise you will create an Azure Blueprint at the Management Group scope to model your Azure environment using Azure Blueprint artifacts such as resource groups, Azure Resource Manager templates, resource locks, Azure Policy, and Azure RBAC.

### Task 1: Create a new Azure Blueprint

In this task, you will create a new Azure Blueprint and add several artifacts to the blueprint. You will then save a draft of the blueprint.

1. Sign out and sign back into the portal with your regular global admin credentials. 

2. In the Azure portal at <https://portal.azure.com> navigate to the Azure Blueprints service by selecting **All services**, searching for **Blueprints**, and then selecting **Blueprints**.

    ![Blueprints service under the All services menu.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image117.png "Azure Blueprints under All services in the Azure portal")

    > **Tip**: You can pin the Blueprints service to the portal navigation by selecting the star next to **Blueprints**.

3. In the **Getting started** blade, select **Create** under **Create a blueprint**. 

    ![Getting started blade with the Create button under Create a blueprint highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image118.png "Create a blueprint")

4. Select **Start with a blank blueprint**.

    ![Choose a blueprint sample blade with the Blank Blueprint tile highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image119.png "Create a blank blueprint")

5. In the **Create blueprint** blade, enter the following to complete the form:

    - Blueprint name: **governance-baseline**

    - Blueprint description: **The governance-baseline blueprint will be applied to all subscriptions within the ERC management group.**
  
    - Definition location: **Enterprise Ready Cloud** management group

    ![Create blueprint blade with the form completed.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image120.png "Create blueprint")

6. Select **Next : Artifacts >>**.

7. Select **+ Add artifact...** and then select **Policy assignment** for the **Artifact type** in the **Add artifact** blade.

    ![Add artifact blade in the Azure portal with the Policy assignment artifact type selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image121.png "Add artifact")

8. Select the **Require a tag on resource groups** policy and select **Add**.

    ![Add artifact blade in the Azure portal with the Policy assignment artifact type selected and the Require a tag on resource groups policy definition highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image132.png "Add artifact policy definition selection")

    > **Note**: In Exercise 2, Azure Policy was used to automatically tag resources as they were created in a resource group but recall that any tags on the resource group itself were not inherited. Through this blueprint, we will ensure that the *IOCode* and *CostCenter* tags are enforced on each resource group that is created *and* that the tags that are set on the resource group are automatically inherited by any child resources.

9.  Select **+ Add artifact...** and then select **Policy assignment** for the **Artifact type** in the **Add artifact** blade.

    ![Add artifact blade in the Azure portal with the Policy assignment artifact type selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image121.png "Add artifact")

10. Select the **Require a tag on resource groups** policy and select **Add**.

    ![Add artifact blade in the Azure portal with the Policy assignment artifact type selected and the Require a tag on resource groups policy definition highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image132.png "Add artifact policy definition selection")

    > **Note**: We need to add two of the same policy definition so we can enforce each tag for *IOCode* and *CostCenter*.

11. Select **+ Add artifact...** and then select **Policy assignment** for the **Artifact type** in the **Add artifact** blade.

    ![Add artifact blade in the Azure portal with the Policy assignment artifact type selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image121.png "Add artifact")

12. Select the **Append a tag and its value from the resource group** policy and select **Add**.

    ![Add artifact blade in the Azure portal with the Policy assignment artifact type selected and the Append a tag and its value from the resource group policy definition highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image123.png "Add artifact policy definition selection")

13. Select **+ Add artifact...** and then select **Policy assignment** for the **Artifact type** in the **Add artifact** blade.

    ![Add artifact blade in the Azure portal with the Policy assignment artifact type selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image121.png "Add artifact")

14. Select the **Append a tag and its value from the resource group** policy and select **Add**.

    ![Add artifact blade in the Azure portal with the Policy assignment artifact type selected and the Append a tag and its value from the resource group policy definition highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image123.png "Add artifact policy definition selection")

    > **Note**: We need to add two of the same policy definition so we can ensure each tag for *IOCode* and *CostCenter* is replicated from the resource group to any child resources.

15. Select **+ Add artifact...** and then select **Azure Resource Manager template (Subscription)** for the **Artifact type** in the **Add artifact** blade.

    ![Add artifact blade in the Azure portal with the Azure Resource Manager template (Subscription) artifact type selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image125.png "Add artifact")

16. Complete the form with the following information. This resource group will be used to demonstrate that the policy enacted in our blueprint is working by creating a resource group and then creating a storage account within that resource group.

    - Artifact display name: **BU-RG**

17. In the Template field, paste the following template and select **Add**:

    ```json
    {
        "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2018-05-01/subscriptionDeploymentTemplate.json#",

    > **Note**: The template parameters will be determined at the time the blueprint is assigned. This allows us flexibility if we need to make a blueprint assignment multiple times and have it maintain a dynamic nature.

18. Save the blueprint as a draft by selecting the **Save Draft** button.

    ![Create blueprint blade in the Azure portal for with the Save Draft highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image127.png "Save Draft blueprint")

### Task 2: Publish a draft blueprint and assign it

In this task, you will publish the previously created blueprint and assign the blueprint to your subscription.

1. In the portal, select **Blueprint definitions** and then the **governance-baseline** blueprint created in the previous step.

    ![The Blueprint definitions blade in the Azure portal with the governance-baseline blueprint highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image128.png "Blueprint definitions")

2. Select **Publish blueprint**.

    ![The governance-baseline blueprint with the Publish blueprint button highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image129.png "Publish blueprint")

3. Enter a version number (for example *1.0*) in the **Version** field and select **Publish**.

4. Select **Assign blueprint**.

    ![The governance-baseline blueprint with the Assign blueprint button highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image130.png "Assign blueprint button")

5. In the **Assign blueprint** blade, select your target **Subscription**, location (making sure to select a location your previous policy allows such as **East US**), and then scroll down to the **Artifact parameters** section of the blade.

    ![The governance-baseline blueprint Assign blueprint form.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image131.png "Assign blueprint")

6. Complete the **Artifact parameters** section of the blade with the following:

    - Append tag and its value from the resource group - Tag Name: **IOCode**
  
    - Append tag and its value from the resource group - Tag Name: **CostCenter**
  
    - BU-RG
    
    - Require specified tag on resource groups - Tag Name: **IOCode**
  
    - Require specified tag on resource groups - Tag Name: **CostCenter**

    ![The governance-baseline blueprint Assign blueprint form with the Artifact parameters section highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image133.png "Assign blueprint Artifact parameters")

7. Select **Assign**. You will see a notification that the blueprint assignment is being created.

    ![The governance-baseline blueprint assignment being created toast notification.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image134.png "Creating blueprint assignment")

8. You will receive an error that the blueprint assignment cannot be made as the blueprint resource is disallowed by the *Service catalog* policy that was created in Exercise 1

### Task 3: Update the Service catalog policy to allow blueprint assignments

In this task, you will update an existing policy that blocks the deployment of Blueprint assignments to your Azure subscriptions located in the Enterprise Ready Cloud (ERC) management group.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the Policy service.

2. Select the **Definitions** blade followed by the **Service catalog** policy.

    ![The Policy definitions blade in the Azure portal with the Service catalog policy highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image135.png "Policy definitions")

3. Select **Edit definition**.

    ![The Service catalog policy with the Edit definition button highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image136.png "Edit definition")

4. Add a comma after  `Microsoft.Insights` source and select **Enter**. Add the following then select **Save**.

    ```json
    {
        "source": "action",
        "like": "Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprintAssignments/*"
    }
    ```

    ![The Service catalog policy in edit mode with a portion of the new policy highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image137.png "Edit definition")
